**Baychild** is a self-produced all-Filipino trio consisting of **Trescoda** (Justin Makabenta; rapper/producer), **LULU** (Louise Pasasadaba; rapper/vocalist) and **picassio** (Rachel Palacio; vocalist/producer), artists of Visayan descent based in **Leyte**, **Texas** and **California** respectively.

Justin, Louise and Rachel first met in the summer of 2020 after featuring in __ZSunder__'s collaborative album _**ZSunderverse: Iridescence**_, which eventually gathered 300k+ total views on YouTube and 150k+ streams on Spotify. The trio came together as Baychild after writing and performing together their pre-debut single "__Ice__" as the title track of _**ZSunderverse: Ammil**_—a winter-themed follow-up EP to *Iridescence*.

The trio’s approach to music is characterized by **a blend of Western and Eastern pop**, bringing together R&B, neo-soul, k-pop and hip-hop influences. But they also pride themselves in being extremely versatile and being able to take on a variety of styles.

After being featured on **GMA Regional TV Cebu** with “Ice”, Baychild makes their official debut with “**Odd One Out**”—a wavy, melodic R&B/hip-hop song which talks about two cheating lovers trying to put the blame on each other and play victim. The trio was assisted behind the scenes by two other Visayan artists. The track features guitar work by **CLIFF**, who recently featured on Spotify's **New Music Friday PH** with hit singles Kursunada, Higugma, Hush, and Stay, and was engineered by **Amiel Edward**, a.k.a. **YLMRN**, whose credentials involve **Agaron (Denial RC, Deadkey, FRNCHZ)**, **Tom Rodriguez**, **E-Kove** and many more.

According to Justin, the demo was written along with CLIFF back in 2019 prior to the pandemic. It was initially scrapped by both due to the lack of a female vocalist for it. Two years later, with Justin now part of Baychild, they decided to take another shot at it, this time with fellow Filipinos across the world. **About the theme of the song, he said:** "When I'm not writing hip-hop, I'm usually writing R&B, and what better genre to tell a love story than a soulful, melodic, and modern sound like trap soul? Back then, I wanted to take the time to write a typical love song—about what love I wanted to have, but with Odd One Out, it's basically the opposite: **telling yourself what you should look out and not settle for in a relationship**, especially since our generation takes love for granted."

The trio is currently working on several songs for ***ZSunderverse II***, also coming out in September, and gearing up to release more singles throughout the rest of 2021, leading up to an EP in 2022.
